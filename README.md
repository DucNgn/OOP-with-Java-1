#The programs in this repo were written in Java programming language - an Object-Oriented language.#

This repo contains all of my assignments during the term of COMP-248 based on JAVA 8.0 All of them do not have user interface so you will need an IDE to review and comply the code, but they can serve as a demonstrator for the basic concepts of OOP.
